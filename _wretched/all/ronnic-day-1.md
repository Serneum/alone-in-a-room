Day 1, salvage ship The Wretched. Flight Engineer Ronnic reporting. The o ther members of the crew are dead and the engines remain non-operational, though ship integrity remains good and life support systems are still active. I successfully jettisoned the intruder from the airlock, but it remains alive and continues to try to access the ship. With a little luck I can repair the distress beacon and sombody will pick me up. This is Ronnic, the last survivor of The Wretched, signing off.
