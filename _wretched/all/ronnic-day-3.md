Day 3, salvage ship The Wretched. Flight Engineer Ronnic reporting. I awoke to an awful small, a smell that indicated something was wrong with the septic system. The sewage silo had been punctured, either by the creature or by a stray bullet, and it was leaking into the ship. I was able to weld some scrap metal onto the damaged panel, and the smell has begun to dissipate.

I also spent some time today trying to repair the engines. If I can get them going again, I can work on getting myself home. While I was working, one of the engines caught on fire, and many of the electrical components melted. There was nothing I could do but jettison the engine out into space.

As I sit in the bridge and look at all of the monitoring systems, they're all empty. I knew I was likely alone, but the reality sank in today. I will need to come to terms with the idea that I'm not making it home, and I only have myself, and that creature, to talk to. The loneliness gave me a lot of time to think today, and that just led to thoughts of the last encounter with the creature, when I was able to successfully eject it out of the airlock. Something jammed on the outside of the ship and I was never able to fully close the airlock. Every once in a while, I'll hear tapping, scratching, and banging on the door as the creature tries to get back in. The door won't hold forever, so I've begun trying to barricade it as much as I can. I've raided most of the crew quarters and moved the beds and dressers. It won't help, though. Once that door is breached, the vacuum of space will suck all of the air out. My only hope is that my barricade will manage to create a seal strong enough to keep me alive. Hopefully I can...wait...what's that sound? It sounds like the comms system. I can't make out what they're saying. Maybe I can send some sort of message!

...

Despite all of my efforts, I wasn't able to send anything before the comms system cut out again. I thought I had finally adjusted enough of the settings to make out what was being said, but all I heard was "Wretched" and "Lost." Maybe they were looking for me.

Periodically, I hear the creature move around the outside of the ship. I can hear its claws pierce the hull of the ship as it moves. Luckily, the damage isn't deep enough to cause me any problems...yet.

This is Ronnic, signing off.
