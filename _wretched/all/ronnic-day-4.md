Day 4, salvage ship The Wretched. Flight Engineer Ronnic reporting. The proximity alarms on the ship are keeping me up at night as the creature continues to walk around the outside of the ship, trying to find a way in. I've disabled them, and I doubt I will need them. What could be worse than the creature that is already out there?

I also found some sort of black, tar-like substance in one of the rooms today. I think it's the creature's blood from when it got inside the ship and attacked the crew. I took a sample and noticed that the substance seemed to be shifting around when I would approach certain rooms or machinery. Is it some sort of ferrofluid? How would that benefit a living creature?

This is Ronnic, signing off.
