Day 2, salvage ship The Wretched. Flight Engineer Ronnic reporting. A large portion of my grains and fruits have spoiled. A power blip caused the climate control the shut down, and the failsafe malfunctioned. I do not know how long it was down before I noticed, but it was likely overnight. The food is covered in mold and is irrecoverable. I should have noticed it yesterday but I was too busy dealing with that invader. I guess it's freeze-dried rations from here on out; hopefully I can last long enough to be rescued.

This is Ronnic, signing off.
