The creature can survive out in the cold back of space, where nothing should be able to live. Is it coming int oyour territory to destroy you, or is it simply defending its domain?
You have been carrying a rifle with you for a few days now. You pried it out of the cold grip of a dead crewmate's hands. How did that make you feel, and do you think the rifle will be effective if you need to use it?
Something happened to the lights when the creature was near your hiding place. What was it?
Which member of the crew jumped into harm's way to try and protect the others, and how much time did they buy you all?
