What do you imagine the creature calls itself?
You had to use someone else's ID to access an area of the ship normally forbidden to you. Whos ID was it, and what were you doing there?
You didn't see the creature properly because you were hiding, but you heard it. What did it sound like?
You lose power throughout the ship, and while you're trying to fix it the backup generator fails too. You manage to restore power, but you need to cannibalize parts from the backup generator, which will never work again.
While you slept the fire suppression system was activated. What caused the fire, and how will you make sure it doesn't happen again?
