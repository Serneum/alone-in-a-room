After you threw the creature out of the airlock, it spent a few hours trying to get through the small windows of the observatory deck - the only glass on the ship. You fear their integrity has been compromised, so you spent an hour reinforcing them by welding sheets of metal over the inside.

Remaining dice: 4
Tokens: 10
