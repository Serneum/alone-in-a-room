You spend a day taking the engine apart completely and putting back together in an attempt to fix it, but you're not sure exactly how to do that and you suspect you may have caused more damage than you fixed.
After days of trying you have finally managed to repair your distress beacon and activate it. 10 tokens, on a roll of 6, remove a token. If you remove all tokens, someone responds to your beacon.
before the creature came you were in the very early stages of pursuing a relationship with another member of the crew. What was the last thing you said to them, and why do you regret it?

Remaining dice: 7
Tokens: 10
