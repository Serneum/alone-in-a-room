In its attempts to get back into the ship, the creature detaches one of the habitat modules and sets it adrift in space. You manage to seal off that area of the ship before the creature can gain real access.
Shortly before your engines failed, the ship was struck by a small asteroid that didn't appear on the scanners. Oxygen has slowly been leaking out of the hull where it hit, but you spent a few hours fixing it.
You had to climb up into a narrow crawlspace to fix some faulty lighting. What was it like, squeezed in there between the cables and the hull of the ship?

Remaining dice: 7
