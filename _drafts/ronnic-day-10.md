You spend a day clearing bodies out of a small room that you intend to hold up in if the creature gets aboard again. What was its purpose before this happened, and why were there so many people here when the creature came?
You find a way to distract the creature from its attempts to gain access to the ship. What is it?
Today you felt like giving up. You couldn't summon any energy, and your tasks weren't completed.

Remaining dice: 2
Tokens: 10
