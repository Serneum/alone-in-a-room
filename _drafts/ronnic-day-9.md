While rummaging through the crew quarters you found a took you've been in need of. What was it?
make a list of the five best hiding places on the ship in the event that you need to use them
You found the journal of one of your crewmates. What thing from home were they missing the most?
The creature whispers to you through the ship's comms. You don't know how it does it. What do you hear before you kill the audio?
You've been finding it harder and harder to catch your breath, and eventually it dawned on you that the oxygen system had shut itself off. You fixed it, but what caused it to break?
You manage to gain access to one of the lander modules, in the hop that you can use it to escape the ship, but the asteroid that struck the ship before your engines failed damaged it beyond repair. You cast it adrift into the black in the hope that it will distract the creature.
