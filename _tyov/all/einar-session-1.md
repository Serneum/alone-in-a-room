### Prompt
In your blood-hunger, you destroy someone close to you. Kill a mortal Character. Take the skill _Bloodthirsty_.

### Response
After returning from our latest raid on England, I find that I have new..._urges_. I fight them as long as I can, often going to the surrounding areas and feeding on the blood of deer or squirrels. One day, Geir follows me catches me off-guard. We get into an argument, and in my hunger I attack him. The sensation is incredible, but my best friend is now dead. I leave his body in the woods away from our village so that it cannot be found, and I carve another notch into my axe when I get home.
