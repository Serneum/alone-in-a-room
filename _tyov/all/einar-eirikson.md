### Memories

1.
  - I am Einar Eirikson, son of Eirik Asgerson, born in Hornstrandir in the 9th century; I am a poor farmer, relying on raids to boost my influence and provide for my family.

2.
  - Geir and I go on our first raid. We watch each other's backs and make sure we both make it home. I carve a notch in my axe's handle for each foe slain.

3.
  - Eirik, my father, teaches me the family recipe for mead. I get my first taste and it is foul.

4.
  - Hege and I are out tending to our fields when she goes into labor. My son is born shortly after.

5.
  - Geir has been killed by Wulfnoð. I chase him into the forests around the battlefield where he surprises me and stabs me through the chest, though I do not die.

### Mark

Part of Wulfnoð's blade remains embedded in my chest. I wear loose-fitting clothing to hide it as best as I can.
