### Memories

1.
  - I am Einar Eirikson, son of Eirik Asgerson, born in Hornstrandir in the 9th century; I am a poor farmer, relying on raids to boost my influence and provide for my family.

2.
  - After Geir and I go on our first raid, I carve a notch in my axe's handle for each foe slain.
  - I kill Geir and hide his body; I will not forget him.
  - I side with Henri when The Syndicate fractures; we become good friends.

3.
  - Eirik, my father, teaches me the family recipe for mead; I get my first taste and it is foul.
  - A small child finds me hiding from the sun and offers me his small cup of water.

4.
  - Hege and I are out tending to our fields when she goes into labor and gifts me with a son.
  - I flee the village with my son, leaving Hege behind.

5.
  - I chase Wolfnoð into the forests around the battlefield after he wounds Geir; Wolfnoð surprises me and stabs me through the chest, though I do not die.
  - I am almost killed in France, though I am saved by Henri.

### Mark

Part of Wulfnoð's blade remains embedded in my chest. I wear loose-fitting clothing to hide it as best as I can.
